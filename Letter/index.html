                            you are the best person I met in this college life, I will make sure this bond will never break. You are the one who always gave me correct advice, you are the one with whom I went for first ever hackathon of my life. There are many such things that you had done for me, I can't even remember the count.
                            I can't write a big paragraphs like others but at the end I just want you to know you means alot in my life.
